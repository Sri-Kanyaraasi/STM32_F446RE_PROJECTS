UART-Transmitter

Steps to transmit data using the UART protocol on the STM32F446RE microcontroller.  

Configure the UART interface: First,  configure the UART interface with the desired parameters such as baud rate, parity, data bits, and stop bits, then configure the UART interface using the STM32CubeMX graphical software configuration tool or by setting the appropriate registers in the microcontroller.  

Write data to the UART transmit buffer: To transmit data over UART,  write the data to the UART transmit buffer. The microcontroller has a dedicated register (USART_TDR) for writing data to the transmit buffer. The HAL_UART_Transmit() function in the HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) library to write data to the transmit buffer.  

Wait for transmission to complete: After writing data to the transmit buffer, wait for the transmission to complete before sending more data. The HAL_UART_Transmit() function to wait for the transmission to complete.  

Repeat the above steps for additional data: To transmit more data, repeat the above steps by writing data to the transmit buffer and waiting for the transmission to complete.
