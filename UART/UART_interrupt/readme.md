UART communication using interrupts on an STM32 microcontroller involves configuring the UART interface for reception or transmission, enabling the appropriate interrupt, and implementing the interrupt service routine (ISR) to handle incoming or outgoing data.

Here are the general steps involved in using interrupts for UART communication on an STM32 microcontroller:

Initialize the UART interface: Configure the UART interface with the desired parameters such as baud rate, parity, data bits, and stop bits. You can configure the UART interface using the STM32CubeMX graphical software configuration tool or by setting the appropriate registers in the microcontroller.

Enable UART interrupts: To use interrupts for UART communication, you need to enable the appropriate interrupt for transmission or reception. You can use the USART_ITConfig() function to enable the interrupt.

Implement the ISR: Implement the ISR function to handle incoming or outgoing data. The ISR function should check the interrupt source and perform the appropriate action.

Transmit or receive data: Once interrupts are enabled and the ISR is implemented, you can start transmitting or receiving data using the UART interface. Data can be transmitted using the HAL_UART_Transmit_IT() function, and data can be received using the HAL_UART_Receive_IT() function
