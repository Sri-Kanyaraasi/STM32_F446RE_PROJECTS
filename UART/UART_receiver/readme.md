To receive data using the UART protocol on the STM32F446RE microcontroller,

Configure the UART interface: First,  configure the UART interface with the desired parameters such as baud rate, parity, data bits, and stop bits then configure the UART interface using the STM32CubeMX graphical software configuration tool or by setting the appropriate registers in the microcontroller.

Enable UART reception: To enable UART reception,  set the appropriate bit in the UART control register (USART_CR1). You can use the HAL_UART_Receive_IT() function in the HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) library to enable interrupt-based reception.

Wait for reception to complete: After enabling UART reception, wait for data to be received before reading it. Use a while loop to wait for the UART receive interrupt to be triggered.

Read data from the UART receive buffer: Once data is received, it is stored in the UART receive buffer. Use the HAL_UART_Receive_IT() function to read data from the receive buffer.

Repeat the above steps for additional data: To receive more data,  repeat the above steps by waiting for the UART receive interrupt to be triggered and reading data from the receive buffer.
