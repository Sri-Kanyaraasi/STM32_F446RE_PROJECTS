UART

UART means Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter. It is a widely used serial communication protocol that allows for the transmission and reception of data between devices.
The STM32-NUCLEO-F446RE has several UART interfaces that can be used for serial communication.
UART communication: The UART transmitter sends data one bit at a time at a fixed baud rate, while the receiver receives the data and reassembles it back into bytes.
Configuration: To use UART on the STM32F446RE, the UART interface needs to be configured first. This involves setting the baud rate, data bits, parity, stop bits, and other parameters.
Data transmission and reception: Once the UART interface is configured, data can be transmitted and received using the microcontroller's UART APIs. The STM32F446RE has several APIs for UART communication, including APIs for transmitting and receiving data, checking for errors, and interrupt handling.
Flow control: The UART protocol supports two types of flow control - hardware flow control and software flow control. Hardware flow control uses dedicated wires to control the flow of data, while software flow control uses special characters to control the flow of data.
DMA support: The STM32F446RE supports Direct Memory Access (DMA), which allows for efficient transfer of data between the UART and memory without requiring CPU intervention.
