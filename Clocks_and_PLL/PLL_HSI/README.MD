The PLL (Phase Locked Loop) module in the STM32F446RE microcontroller can also use the HSI (High-Speed Internal) clock source to generate a higher frequency clock signal called the SYSCLK (System Clock). The HSI clock source is an internal clock source available in the STM32F446RE microcontroller that uses an internal RC circuit to generate a clock signal.  

The steps that the PLL module uses the HSI clock source to generate the SYSCLK:  

The HSI clock source is first connected to the microcontroller's RCC (Reset and Clock Control) module.  

The PLL module multiplies the frequency of the HSI clock source by a programmable factor to generate a higher frequency clock signal.  

The output of the PLL module is then used as the input to the system clock mux, which selects the PLL output as the system clock source.  

The system clock frequency can be further divided using the AHB (Advanced High-performance Bus) prescaler and the APB1 (Advanced Peripheral Bus 1) and APB2 (Advanced Peripheral Bus 2) prescalers to generate lower frequency clock signals for different peripherals
