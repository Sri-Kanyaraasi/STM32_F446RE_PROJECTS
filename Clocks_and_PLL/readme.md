CLOCKS  
  
  Clocks are essential components in microcontroller like STM32-NUCLEO-F446RE. Clocks provide the timing referrence for the operation of the entire system. These microcontrollers have many on-chip peripherals that need precise and synchronized timing to function correctly  
  
These are some of the clocks in STM32-F446RE:  
HSI (High-Speed Internal) Clock : This is inside the microcontroller and runs at maximum frequency of 16 MHz.  
HSE (High-Speed External) Clock : This is connected externally to the microcontroller and run at frequencies up to 26 MHz.  
PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) Clock : This clock is generated by multiplying the frequency of the HSE or HSI clock source by a programmable factor.   
LSI (Low-Speed Internal) CLock : This is a low-frequency clock source (32 kHz) that can be used for RTC (Real-Time Clock) functions.  
LSE (Low-Speed External) Clock: This is an external clock source (32.768 kHz) that can be used for RTC functions.  
APB1 (Advanced peripheral bus) Clock: This is the clock source for peripherals connected to the APB1 bus, which runs at a maximum frequency of 42 MHz.  
APB2 Clock: This is the clock source for peripherals connected to the APB2 bus, which runs at a maximum frequency of 84 MHz.
