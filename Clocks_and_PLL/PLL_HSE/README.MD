The PLL (Phase Locked Loop) module in the STM32F446RE microcontroller can use the HSE (High-Speed External) clock source to generate a higher frequency clock signal called the SYSCLK (System Clock).  

The PLL module uses the HSE clock source to generate the SYSCLK as follows :  

1)The HSE clock source is first connected to the microcontroller's RCC module.  

2)The PLL module multiplies the frequency of the HSE clock source by a programmable factor to generate a higher frequency clock signal.  

3)The output of the PLL module is then used as the input to the system clock mux, which selects the PLL output as the system clock source.  

4)The system clock frequency can be further divided using the AHB (Advanced High-performance Bus) prescaler and the APB1 (Advanced Peripheral Bus 1) and APB2 (Advanced Peripheral Bus 2) prescalers to generate lower frequency clock signals for different peripherals.
